# HTMLAutoImagePlayer
 The HTML Auto Image Player I use for my wedding.

## Steps To Use

1. Add Your Images under the [img](./img) subfolder
    * It doesn't matter if you have folders under folders. We can handle it in the next step.
2. Run the Python script [generate_filelist.py](./generate_filelist.py) to generate new data list file **my_helper.js**
3. Open [my_demo.html](./my_demo.html) in your browser (e.g. Chrome)
